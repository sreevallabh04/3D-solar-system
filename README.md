# 🌞 3D Solar System (Three.js)

Welcome to the interactive 3D Solar System! This project is a visually rich, real-time simulation of our solar system, built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and modern web technologies. Perfect for learning, exploring, or just enjoying some cosmic eye-candy by sreevallabh

## ✨ Features
- Realistic, animated planets with custom shaders
- Dynamic orbits, asteroid and Kuiper belts
- Glowing, animated sun and twinkling star field
- Solar wind particles
- Smooth camera controls (drag, zoom, touch)
- Real-time speed controls (global & per-planet)
- Tooltips with planet facts
- Modern, glassy UI with dark/light mode
