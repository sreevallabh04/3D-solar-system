# ðŸŒž 3D Solar System Internship Walkthrough

Hey everyone! I'm excited to walk you through my interactive 3D Solar System project, built with Three.js. This was a fantastic learning experience, and I can't wait to show you the features, the tech behind it, and how I approached the challenge.

## 1. The 3D Solar System in Motion

So, what are you looking at? This is a real-time, animated model of our solar system:
- Each planet orbits the sun at its own speed and rotates on its axis.
- The sun glows and pulses with a custom shader, and there are animated solar wind particles.
- There are thousands of twinkling stars in the background, plus asteroid and Kuiper belts for extra realism.
- You can drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, and even use touch controls on mobile.
- Hovering over a planet pops up a tooltip with fun facts and stats!

## 2. Real-Time Speed Control

One of my favorite features is the speed control:
- **Global Speed:** There's a master slider on the right. Slide it, and the whole system speeds up or slows down instantly. This updates the `globalSpeed` variable, which multiplies all orbital and rotational speeds in real time.
- **Individual Planet Speed:** Each planet has its own slider, so you can make, say, Mercury zip around or slow Neptune to a crawl. This is done by adjusting each planet's `individualSpeed` property.
- **Pause/Resume:** Hit the Pause button or press <kbd>Space</kbd> to freeze or resume the action. Super handy for demos!

## 3. How I Built the Planets and Orbits

- **Planets:**
  - All the planet data (size, color, speed, etc.) is in a `planetData` array. I loop through this to create each planet as a high-detail sphere with a custom shader for surface and glow effects.
  - Special touches: Saturn has rings, Jupiter has its Great Red Spot, and Earth, Venus, and Mars have atmospheric glows.
- **Orbits:**
  - Each planet gets a colored orbit line, calculated with simple trigonometry and drawn with `THREE.Line`.
- **Asteroid & Kuiper Belts:**
  - These are made with thousands of tiny points, randomly placed between Mars/Jupiter and beyond Neptune.
- **Sun & Stars:**
  - The sun uses a custom animated shader for a dynamic look, with extra spheres for glow and corona.
  - The star field is a big `THREE.Points` object with a twinkling shader.

## 4. Quick Folder & Code Tour

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Frontend Assignment (1).pdf
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # Main HTML & UI structure
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js            # All the Three.js logic & controls
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json       # Project setup & dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json  # Dependency lock file
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css          # Modern, glassy, responsive styles
```

- **index.html:** Sets up the UI, canvas, and loads the script.
- **style.css:** Handles all the visuals, including dark/light themes and glassmorphism.
- **main.js:**
  - The heart of the project! Defines the `StellarSystemSimulation` class.
  - Handles everything: scene setup, planet creation, animation, UI controls, camera, tooltips, and more.
  - Uses custom GLSL shaders for advanced visuals.

## What I Learned & Why I Loved This

- I got hands-on with Three.js, especially custom shaders and real-time animation.
- Learned how to structure a complex interactive app, keep code modular, and connect UI to 3D logic.
- Practiced making a project that's both visually impressive and user-friendly.

## If I Had More Time...
- I'd add moons, comets, and maybe some post-processing effects (like bloom or lens flare).
- More interactivity: click a planet to "fly to" it, or toggle planet trails.
- Maybe even a VR mode!

Thanks for checking out my project! ðŸš€ I had a blast building it and hope you enjoy exploring the solar system as much as I enjoyed creating it.
